# NewsFeedSwitcher

NewsFeedSwitcher is a simple web-based application that provides the user with a feed of news articles from two different sources: AnimeNewsNetwork (via Consumet API) and Inshorts. Users can switch between these two sources with a simple click. Moreover, when Inshorts is selected, users are able to search for news articles by keywords.

## Usage

Since it's a static HTML file, you can simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser to run the application. 

Alternatively, you can host it on any static file server. The application will be accessible at the root of your server (e.g., `http://localhost`).
